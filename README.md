![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=https://github.com/Shurun-Wang/sEMGDetection&label=visitors&countColor=%232ccce4&style=plastic)  This is the official source code repository of "A Double Threshold Adaptive Method for Robust Detection of Muscle Activation Intervals From Surface Electromyographic Signals".

We provide the test data for running the algorithm
We provide the core algorithm and remove other contents for readability and easy to implement.

Step 1: Run the main1.m to get the entropy feature.

Step 2: Run the main2.m to detect the onsets and offsets of the sEMG activation intervals.
